--- Interface Specification
  Identifier: SIM|MON
  Description: This interface provides the information needed by WP-MON from WP-SIM

  Type of maneuver: deceleration short-brake
  Type of simulator: Esminiss

  Functional Scenario: In this scenario
    Leading car performs as follow:
        1- At the beginning of the scenario it has a constant speed of 16.66 m/s for 3 seconds.
        2- For the next 1.5 seconds it decelerates gradually until it reaches the speed of 8.5 m/s.
        3- Then it continues with this speed for 3 seconds.
        4- At the end it gradually accelerate for 1.5 seconds to reach the speed of 16.66 m/s.
        Note that the leading car acceleration varies between -5.45 and 5.45.
    ALKS performs as follow:
        1- At the beginning of the scenario it has a constant speed of 16.66 m/s for 5.5 seconds.
        2- For the next 1.5 seconds it decelerates gradually until it reaches the speed of 12 m/s.
        3- Then it continues with this speed for 4.1 seconds.
        4- At the end it gradually accelerate for 1.5 seconds to reach the speed of 14 m/s.
        Note that the ALKS acceleration varies between -3.1 and 1.35.
