--- Interface Specification
  Identifier: SIM|FSR
  Description: This interface specification specifies the output that WP-SIM requires from WP-FSR.
  Goal:  
    - WP-SIM needs some information from WP-FSR for generating deceleration scenario.
  Considerations:
    - SI metric should be used to specify numbers.
    - Specify the exact number or the range an observable should operate.
  Requirements:
    - The type of ALKS maneuver (e.g. short-brake, complete stop, ...)
    - The Operational Domain (road type, number of lanes, lane markings)
    - The number and type of actors
    - Initial conditions required.
        - time headway
        - velocity of each car
        - acceleration of each car
        - relative longitudinal or lateral distance (if needed).
    - Final conditions required.
        - time headway
        - velocity of each car
        - acceleration of each car
        - relative longitudinal or lateral distance if needed.
    - Limitations that should be specified during maneuver.
        - time of deceleration and acceleration of each car (jerking).
        - max and min deceleration.
        - max and min acceleration.
        - reaction time of alks.
        - perception and evaluation time of alks.
    - Conditions that should be specified during maneuver.
        - the condition which the maneuver starts (e.g. the leading car reaches the acceleration of -5)
        - the condition which the maneuver ends (e.g. time headway > 2s)
        - any other specific condition that needs to be fullfilled in order to generate a successful scenario.
        - any other special condition e.g. a barrier in the middle of the road or occurrence an accident.
    - Observables that have to be generated during simulation should be specified. 
  Required Input:
    TSC:
      - A TSC that shows the actors and their behaviour in seperate blocks.
      - A TSC that shows the important constraints.
      - A TSC that contains a symbol and vocabulary dictionary to explain all the items used in the TSC 
        (an accurate description of PE and reaction time would be helpful).
      - A TSC that is well adjusted with time automata.
      - A TSC that covers the requirements mentioned above as much as possible.
      - A TSC which shows time headway, jerking and accleration range of each vehicle in each snapshot.
    Text file:
      - The text file should include a link to the functional description of the scenario.
      - The text file should include the exact name of observables that have to be generated during simulation.
        (observable names should be compatible with WP-MON)
      - The text file should include the link of the specific TSC created for this maneuver.
      - The text file should include conditions that result in an unsuccessful scenario.
      - The text file should include the constants used in the TSC.
